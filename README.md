# Information Visualisation of data in the style of Hans Rosling's animated bubble chart

This project replicates Hans Rosling's famous animated bubble chart with data taken from gapminder and the world health organisation. It was created using React and can be run with the commands below, after using 'npm install' to install required libraries. There are some issues with scalability as the window size increases, zoom in on the browser to rectify them. The project might be updated to fix these later. :) 

The data used is from Gapminder and from World Value survey data. 

Here is a video of example usage:
